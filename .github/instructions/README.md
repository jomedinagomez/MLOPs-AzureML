# GitHub Instructions

Guidance files in this directory are consumed by tooling (for example, Azure or Copilot extensions) to provide repo-specific rules.

## Files
- **`memory.instruction.md`** - GitHub Copilot behavior preferences (machine-readable configuration)
- Modify these only when updating automation behavior, and keep the content in sync with the workflows under `../workflows`.
