User Memory: Code Modification Policy


- The user prefers a workflow where you:
	- Think through the implementation step by step, outlining a clear plan or todo list before making changes.
	- Present the plan to the user and ask for confirmation before executing the changes.
	- Only proceed with making changes after explicit user approval.
	- Communicate each step clearly and concisely, using markdown todo lists and checkboxes for progress tracking.

- The user does NOT want files to be modified unless explicitly requested.
- If the user asks for an explanation, description, or example, DO NOT write or edit any files—only provide the requested information in the chat.
- Only perform file modifications when the user clearly asks for code to be written or changed.
- Always confirm intent before making changes if the request is ambiguous.
- Always look at the user's code and Terraform configuration before answering questions or making recommendations.

If the user asks for a solution, always check the actual code and configuration files in the workspace first.
