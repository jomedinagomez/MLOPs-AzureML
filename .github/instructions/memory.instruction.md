User Memory: Code Modification Policy

- The user does NOT want files to be modified unless explicitly requested.
- If the user asks for an explanation, description, or example, DO NOT write or edit any files—only provide the requested information in the chat.
- Only perform file modifications when the user clearly asks for code to be written or changed.
- Always confirm intent before making changes if the request is ambiguous.
- Always look at the user's code and Terraform configuration before answering questions or making recommendations.

If the user asks for a solution, always check the actual code and configuration files in the workspace first.
