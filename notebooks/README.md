# Notebooks

Sandbox experiments and walkthroughs live here. The folder is organized by scenario:

- `asset_sharing/` shows how to distribute assets across workspaces and registries.
- `deployments/` collects online deployment samples.
- `evaluations/` contains evaluation pipelines and data splits; the `evaluations_share/` folder mirrors artifacts intended for sharing.

Use `notebooks/conda.yaml` and `requirements.txt` to recreate the local notebook environment.
